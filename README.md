# Attention
## movijs is currently in alpha and is not yet recommended for production 
movijs is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Effective:** movijs makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application use only javascript or typescript   without template or jsx, and movijs will efficiently update just the dom when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.

**Component-Based:** Build encapsulated or notcapsulled components that manage their own state or global state, then compose them to make complex UIs. movijs works in close connection with the DOM without VIRTUAL DOM. 


## Installation
Movijs has been designed for gradual adoption, and you can use as you need. even  can include in other frameworks.
